# FibonacciJavaTask

The main purpose of the task was to read numbers from the input file. The numbers in the file were as in the example below:
a;b;c;

It was necessary to check whether a + b = c;

The final result should display how many times the sum was correct.The more important part of the job was that the numbers were very large (10,000 characters) and time efficiency was a priority.

Eventually, the recruiter was defeated. Recruiter's result: 7.14 seconds, my code: 4.02 seconds :)
